# Credit-Risk-Model
Models to predict who won't pay back their loans!!, before they are even granted.
## CREDIT RISK MODEL USING ML
## AIM:
The main aim of this project is to explore the dataset and discuss some interesting observations through visualizations and train machine learning models to predict the probabilty of default (PD), Loss given default (LGD) and Exposure at default (EAD) based on various features using supervised learning.

Credit risk analysis is a form of analysis performed by a credit analyst on potential borrowers to determine their ability to meet debt obligations. The main goal of credit analysis is to determine the creditworthiness of potential borrowers and their ability to honor their debt obligations.

If the borrower presents an acceptable level of default risk, the analyst can recommend the approval of the credit application at the agreed terms. The outcome of the credit risk analysis determines the risk rating that the borrower will be assigned and their ability to access credit.

## DEPLOYMENT:
This model will be deployed on Heroku.

## MODELS:
- PD model using Logistic regression (It predicts probability of default).
- LGD model (in pipeline)
- EAD model (in pipeline)

## Tools: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn.
